Let's install NATS and the wasmCloud host runtime with Docker. You should have already installed [prerequisites and wash](/overview/installation/). Additionally, make sure your Docker install has [Compose v2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#installing-compose-v2).

Download the [sample Docker Compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/examples/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) and put it into your work directory. This compose file will run NATS, a local OCI registry, a Redis container, and the `wasmcloud_host` container. In this format it's easy to run all the necessary services for a wasmCloud host with only a docker installation.

#### Starting the wasmCloud host with docker

With the `docker-compose.yml` file in the current directory, start the processes with

```bash
docker compose up
```

The host will run until you type ctrl-c or close the terminal window. To start the docker compose process in the background, add a `-d` flag:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If the wasmCloud host is running in docker in the background, you can view its logs (live) with

```bash
docker logs -f wasmcloud
```

That's it! Let's move on to [Getting started](/overview/getting-started/)
