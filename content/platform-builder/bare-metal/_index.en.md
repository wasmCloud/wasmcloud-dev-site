Running `wasmcloud` on "bare metal" is an incredibly easy default. You'll likely be taking advantage of this as you develop solutions on your workstation before deploying to production. If you've gone through the basic [installation](overview/installation/) instructions, then you'll have the `wasmcloud` binary installed on your system, provided your system is one of the supported operating systems and processor architectures.

If the deployed, pre-compiled binaries don't work for your environment, then you can [build your own](../custom-host) custom host, compiling it however you choose; optimized for your needs.
