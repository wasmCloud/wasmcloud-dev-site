The wasmcloud documentation is separated out _roughly_ by task. If you are a _platform builder_, and are working on building a foundation on which other application developers can build, then you'll want to check out the [platform builder](/platform-builder) section.

This section is for application developers--developers looking to build applications that they can take from a napkin sketch to production. If you're looking to build portable, composable, easily deployed business logic that can securely utilize all kinds of capabilities without ever taking on direct dependencies, then this section is for you.
