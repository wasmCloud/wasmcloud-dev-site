We all like to think we can write perfect code. Unfortunately, this isn't always the case. When you get errors in a distributed system it can be difficult to track down the source of the problem; the goal of this guide will be to give you the tools to do this within wasmCloud.

The following sections detail ways to track down errors with specific wasmCloud components, as well as some of the most common issues we see when getting started with wasmCloud applications. It's recommended to start with the [Host Troubleshooting](./host) guide first, as it details how to find wasmCloud's logs.

- [Host Troubleshooting](./host)
- [Actor Troubleshooting](./actors)
- [Provider Troubleshooting](./providers)
- [Common Errors](./common)
