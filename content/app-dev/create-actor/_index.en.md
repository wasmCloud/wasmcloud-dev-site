Creating an actor with wasmCloud is simple and easy. Today, we support actors created in **Rust** but we will soon have support for other languages as those languages develop better tooling and support for WebAssembly.

To perform the steps in this guide, you'll need to have completed [installation](/overview/installation/) of the wasmCloud host and prerequisites, and the Rust [wasm32 target](../getting-started/).

This guide will walk you through the following steps to create an actor:

* [Generating a new actor project](./generate)
* [Running the actor](./run)
* [Customizing the actor and performing a live update](./update)
