Creating a capability provider is one of the more involved tasks when working within the wasmCloud ecosystem. First, you need to decide if you're creating a new provider for an existing contract or if you're creating an entirely new contract.

If you do not need to create a new contract, then you can skip to step 2 in this guide:

1. [Create a new contract](./new_contract)
1. [Create the Rust capability provider](./rust)
1. [Consume the new capability provider](./consuming) (create actors that use this provider)
