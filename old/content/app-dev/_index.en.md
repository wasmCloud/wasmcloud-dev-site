The wasmCloud documentation is organized by task. If you are a _platform builder_, and are working on providing a foundation on which other application developers can build, then you'll want to check out the [platform builder](/platform-builder) section. If you're thinking about building your own capability providers, creating new capability contracts, or customizing deployment for various enterprise scenarios, then the **platform builder** section is for you.

This section is for application developers--developers looking to build distributed applications that they can take from a napkin sketch to production. If you're looking to build portable, composable, easily deployed business logic that can securely utilize all kinds of capabilities without being tightly linked to direct dependencies, then this **app development** section is for you.
