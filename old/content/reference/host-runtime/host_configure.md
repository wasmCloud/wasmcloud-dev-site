The wasmcloud host is configured by environment variables, which can be set in the environment or `.env` files. 
Real environment variables take precedence over values found in `.env` files. 
Some of the values contain secrets and should be protected accordingly.

The following sources of environment variables will be considered:

* `.env`
* `.env.local`
* `.env.[dev|test|prod]`
* `.env.[dev|test|prod].local`

As mentioned, any environment variable supplied at runtime will override variables supplied in any `.env` file. Best practice suggests that developers use the `.local` files to represent their local workstation environments and to not check those files into source control.

Environment variables and `.env` files are combined to create a **host configuration** file in the same directory that started the host. The generated `host_config.json` file contains all of the values that were used to launch the most recent host and can be edited and used directly instead of specifying your configuration values each time. This also means that launching subsequent hosts on your machine will automatically connect to the same lattice as your previously launched host.
(To edit the file, open in a json-aware editor such as VS Code, or you can use `jq` to pretty-format it and edit with any text editor.)

### Supported configuration variables

These variables can be set in your shell environment to configure a host. After your first time launching a host, these variables are also available for modification in `host_config.json` as mentioned above, mostly under the same name without the `WASMCLOUD_` prefix.

### Character sets

A __lattice prefix__ is composed of one or more of the following characters: `A-Za-z_-` (upper- and lower- case ascii letters, digits, dash, and underscore). Spaces, periods, non-ascii characters, and non-printable ascii characters are specifically not allowed.
We recommended that lattice prefix names be limited to the characters listed above for maximum compatibility with future wasmcloud protocols.
