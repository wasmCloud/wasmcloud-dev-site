The [_wasmCloud Host Runtime_](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp) is an Elixir/OTP application that provides a distributed, resilient, highly performant runtime in which to run actors and capability providers.

There are also specialized versions of the runtime available, such as [JavaScript](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-js).
