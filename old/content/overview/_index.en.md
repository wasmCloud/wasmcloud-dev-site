wasmCloud is a platform designed to help developers quickly and easily code secure-by-default business logic with a rapid feedback loop that is free from the burden of boilerplate, integrated (e.g. tangled) dependencies, and tight coupling to non-functional requirements. It is a suite of tools and libraries that can be used to build distributed applications composed of portable units of business logic called _actors_.

The creators of wasmCloud believe that we can not only change the way developers build software for the better, but make it easier to secure, deploy, maintain, observe, and upgrade that software as well--all while reducing the amount of boilerplate we have to copy and paste.

wasmCloud is designed around the following core tenets:

* Productivity - Developers _and_ Operations
* Enterprise-Grade Security
* Cost Savings
* Portability
* Performance

You should not have to change your design, architecture, or your programming environment as you move from concept to production.

**We want to bring _joy_ to distributed systems development without sacrificing enterprise-grade features.**
