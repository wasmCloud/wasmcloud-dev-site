wasmCloud includes the default, [OTP-based](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp) host runtime. We also have a [JavaScript-based](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-js) host runtime. However, there is nothing preventing anyone from making other specialized applications that can act as a wasmCloud host.

As long as core specifications and requirements are met, anyone can build a wasmCloud host that participates meaningfully within a lattice network.
