wasmCloud is more than just a runtime and framework that helps developers build distributed applications free of boilerplate and traditional portability constraints. The wasmCloud ecosystem is also a tool for building platforms. You can develop extensions that make the lives of developers and operations easier. You can deploy wasmCloud hosts on everything from Raspberry Pis to virtual servers to Kubernetes nodes. You can use the self-forming, self-healing mesh network _lattice_ to build all kinds of extra features that developers and operations can leverage.

In this section of the documentation, explore guides that will take you and your team's use of wasmCloud to the next level, helping you build your own foundations, products, and extensions on top of the wasmCloud core.
