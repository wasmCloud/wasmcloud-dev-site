Running the wasmCloud host runtime from a docker image is nearly as easy as running it locally. For more information on the docker image and how to use it, please see the official [wasmCloud at docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/wasmcloud), or view the [Install with docker](/overview/installation/install-with-docker/) installation guide.
