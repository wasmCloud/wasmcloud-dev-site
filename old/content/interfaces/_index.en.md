At its core, wasmCloud is a messaging system, and a scalable messaging system needs well-defined API contracts.

Every [capability provider](/reference/host-runtime/capabilities/) has a capability contract - an interface definition - that defines a service and a set of operations it supports. Even [actor-to-actor](/app-dev/a2a/) messages, which don't use capability contracts, benefit by well-defined API contracts. In wasmCloud, we define these API contracts in [Smithy](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/index.html) files.

In this section, you will find documentation on how to define interfaces using smithy IDL files, and use code generation to create libraries from those definitions.
- [Tutorial](/app-dev/create-provider/new-interface/) on creating a new interface project
- [The wasmCloud-smithy guide](./wasmcloud-smithy/): how wasmCloud uses smithy models, with examples
- Configuring the code generator with [`codegen.toml`](./codegen-toml/) files
- How [Code generation](.//code-generation/) works, with pointers for customizing it or writing your own code generator
- [Tips](./tips/) for building and debugging smithy models
- [Publishing](./crates-io/) Rust interface libraries to crates.io
