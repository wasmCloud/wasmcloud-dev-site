**GoDocs** has been built to be as configurable as possible.


### Change the logo

In `config.toml` you will find a logo variable. you can change your logo there.

```toml
logo = "images/logo.png"
```

{{< notice "tip" >}}
The size of the logo will adapt automatically
{{< /notice >}}

### Change the favicon

If your favicon is a png, just drop off your image in your local `static/images/` folder and name it `favicon.png`

If you need to change this default behavior, create a new file in `layouts/partials/` named `head.html`. Then write something like this:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/images/favicon.png" type="image/x-icon" />
```
