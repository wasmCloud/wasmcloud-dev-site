# wasmCloud.dev
The previous home for wasmCloud documentation! After our [documentation epic](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com-dev/pull/35), all documentation source code is now served in the [wasmcloud.com-dev](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com-dev/) repository and is hosted at [https://wasmcloud.com](https://wasmcloud.com). This was done in the interest of keeping all of our content in one place.

If you have any links that refer to `https://wasmcloud.dev`, they will automatically redirect to `https://wasmcloud.com`.
